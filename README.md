This repository demonstrates a common Firebase error involving data type mismatches. The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases code that retrieves data from Firebase and attempts to process it without proper type checking.  This can lead to runtime errors. The `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust type checking to prevent these issues.  This is a crucial aspect of building reliable Firebase applications.
